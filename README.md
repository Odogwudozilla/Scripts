# Scripts

Scripts I use to automate some processes in my local files

**rename.rb** runs automated file renaming and mv to named folders. Runs on the command line.

**The Scraper**

- My friend asked me for a softcopy of "The Living Bible" by Tyndale. He said he could not find it online.
- I looked too. I couldn't find it either for free or for sale.
- So I wrote a crawler to crawl it from https://www.biblegateway.com/ and convert to PDF.
- It's messy but it does the job.
