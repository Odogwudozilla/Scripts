**The Scraper**

My friend asked me for a softcopy of "The Living Bible" by Tyndale. He said he could not find it online.
I looked too. I couldn't find it either for free or for sale.
So I wrote a crawler to crawl it from https://www.biblegateway.com/ and convert to PDF.
It's messy but it does the job.
